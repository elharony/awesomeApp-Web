# AwesomeApp | Meet a classmate!
AwesomeApp is a Mobile & WebApp to connect Udacity Nanodegree Students together based on their Preferences.

## How it works?
Each Udacity Nanodegree Student will login and set his/her Preferences, and start exploring another classmate who is working on the same project, and start working together!

## What are the Preferences?
It includes:
- Slack Name
- Nanodegree Track
- Current Project
- Preferred Language #1
- Preferred Language #2

## How can I join?
The Application isn't ready for use now, but you can test it from the [Live Preview](https://elharony.github.io/awesomeApp-Web/) and give us your feedback.
